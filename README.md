Tractor cart system control using MRAC adaptive control in Matlab

This is a MATLAB script for controlling a tractor cart system using the Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) system. The MRAC is not the best for controlling this system as it sacrifices robustness for fast adaptation and vice versa. The L1 (the other commit i added on this page ) does a better job at this as the low pass filter helps.
